## 📌 Project Overview

This project was created for the **SE 3355 Web Development** midterm. MarketShop is developed for educational purposes as part of a front-end web development project. It emphasizes interactive UI design, basic user interface behavior with JavaScript, and responsive styling with pure CSS.

## ✨ Features

- **Homepage Interface** – Built using `index.html`, presenting the entire layout structure.
- **Category Display** – Product categories shown as cards, aligned responsively.
- **Campaign Sliders** – Dynamically rendered using data from `fileJson`.
- **JSON Data Integration** – Category cards, products, and banners are pulled from a unified mock JSON file.
- **JavaScript Functions** – Interactivity handled in `functions.js`.
- **Icon Assets** – All icons and images stored under the `assets/` directory.
- **Responsive Design** – Layout styled using `style.css` for multi-device support.

## 📱 Responsive Design Notes

- Mobile-first principles are used to ensure usability across screen sizes.
- Campaign sliders, category cards, and product boxes rearrange on smaller viewports.
- Side menus or icons adapt or hide depending on device width.
